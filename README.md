# Using the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT with BeagleBone Black

This repository contains code that illustrates how to interface the Raspberry Pi
Sense HAT with the BeagleBone Black.  It actually relies on CircuitPython, so
this code should also work on any microcontroller compatible with CircuitPython.
More detailed descriptions of how these tests work can be found on my [personal

## Installation

    sudo apt install python3-venv
    python3 -mvenv adafruit
    . adafruit/bin/activate
